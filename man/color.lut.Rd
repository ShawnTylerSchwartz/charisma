\title{Default Color Labels Look Up Table (LUT)}
\format{
An object of class \code{"data.frame"} to be passed into
\code{\link[=charisma]{charisma()}} functions.
}
\usage{
charisma::color.lut
}
\description{
This LUT contains all color boundaries which cut up the continuous HSV
color space into 10 discrete color labels (i.e., black, white, grey, brown,
red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple).
}
\details{
These color boundaries were determined by forming consensus across three
experts in the biology of color. Color boundaries were intentionally tuned
to reflect accurate color label classifications for images of various
bird and fish museum specimens.

Although we attempted to determine color boundaries in an object fashion,
there are of course perceptual biases and variability across computer models/
displays that can influence whether any given color at the boundary of the
continuous color space is ultimately called one color over another.

Accordingly, we gladly welcome further optimization of the default color LUT
and/or submissions of color LUTS specifically tuned to any given organism or
stimulus. Leveraging contributions from the community will only help
\code{charisma} be more useful for everybody who would like to use it!
